# Crushing Tech Hackathon Submission 2023 - Web Accessibility and UI Design

## Overview

I had the incredible opportunity to participate in crushing tech hackathon that centered around enhancing web accessibility for keyboard users and screen readers. The primary focus was on creating a seamless user interface with an exceptional user experience. Below, I'll provide an overview of the key features and functionalities I implemented during the hackathon.

## Application Overview

I developed a shopify online store onboarding web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a particular emphasis on improving accessibility and user interaction. The application featured a guided user journey, incorporating various UI elements and controls.

### Key Components and Features

#### Guided Stepper

I implemented a guided stepper that dynamically expands and collapses based on user interaction. The stepper allows users to navigate through different steps with ease, ensuring a smooth and accessible flow.

#### Interactive Checkboxes

To enhance user engagement, I incorporated interactive checkboxes with keyboard accessibility. Users could mark steps as complete or incomplete, triggering dynamic UI updates.

#### Page Navigation

For an improved user experience, I implemented page navigation with keyboard support. Keyboard Users can interact with the page using arrow keys.

#### Menu Navigation

For an improved user experience, I implemented menu navigation with keyboard support. Keyboard Users can interact with profile and notification menus using arrow keys.

#### Learning Experience

Throughout the hackathon, I gained valuable insights into the intricacies of web accessibility. I deepened my understanding of creating inclusive designs that cater to users relying on keyboard navigation and screen readers. This experience has further fueled my commitment to delivering user-centric and accessible web solutions.

#### Next Steps

As a lifelong learner, I plan to continue refining my skills in web accessibility and UI/UX design. I am eager to apply the knowledge gained from this hackathon to future projects, ensuring that accessibility remains a top priority in my development endeavors.

#### Hackathon in Action

This hackathon was not just a coding challenge but an opportunity to contribute to a more inclusive web environment. I look forward to incorporating these principles into all my future projects.
